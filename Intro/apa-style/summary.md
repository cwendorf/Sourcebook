## APA Style | Summary of Statistics Reporting

In simple examples - such as those with single outcomes or single statistical tests - it is expected that researchers place statistical information in the text.

### Descriptive Statistics

| **Statistic** | **Purpose** | **APA Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mean | To provide an estimate of the mean of the population from which the sample was selected. | *M* = 4.00 |
| Standard Deviation | To provide an estimate of the amount of variability/dispersion in the distribution of population scores. | *SD* = 3.12 |

### Measures of Effect Size

| **Statistic** | **Purpose** | **APA Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cohen's d | To provide a measure of difference between two means relative to the within-group variability of scores. | *d* = -.96 |
| Correlation | To provide a measure of the size of the association between two variables measured in a sample. | *r*(2) = .50 |
| Eta-Squared | To provide the proportion of variance in a variable accounted for by another variable. | *Î·<sup>2</sup>* = .51 |

### Confidence Intervals

| **Statistic** | **Purpose** | **APA Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CI for a Mean | To provide an interval estimate of the population mean. | 95% CI [-5.61, -0.39] ||
| CI for a Mean Difference | To provide an interval estimate of the population mean difference. | 95% CI [-8.24, 0.24] |

### Statistical Significance Tests

| **Statistic** | **Purpose** | **APA Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| One Sample t Test | To compare a single sample mean to a population mean when the population standard deviation is not known | *t*(7) = -2.72, *p* = .030 |
| Paired Samples t Test | To compare two sample means when the samples are from a single-factor within-subjects design. |*t*(3) = -3.27, *p* = .047 |
| Independent Samples t Test | To compare two sample means when the samples are from a single-factor between-subjects design. | *t*(6) = -2.31, *p* = .060 |
| One-Way ANOVA | To compare two or more sample means when the means are from a single-factor between-subjects design. | *F*(2, 9) = 4.67, p = .041 |
| Repeated Measures ANOVA | To compare two or more sample means when the means are from a single-factor within-subjects design. | *F*(1, 3) = 10.67, p = .047 |
| Factorial ANOVA | To compare four or more groups defined by a multiple variables in a factorial research design. | *F*(1, 12) = 0.67, p = .430 |
