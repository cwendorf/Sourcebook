# Intro

## Background Concepts

### Statistical Analyses

This chapter provides an overview of the types of statistical analyses. This starts with the basic terminology of statistics. It also includes a decision tree for highlighting the typical tests of statistical significance, confidence intervals, and effects sizes used for common univariate research designs.

- [Understanding Statistical Significance Tests](./statistical-analyses/significance.md)
- [Understanding Confidence Intervals](./statistical-analyses/confidence.md)
- [Understanding Effect Size Measures](./statistical-analyses/effects.md)

### Statistical Tables

This chapter provides statistical tables. They are used both as part of the calculation with formulas and part of the interpretations of calculated statistics. 

- [Standard Normal](./statistical-tables/normal.md)
- [Student's *t*](./statistical-tables/t.md)
- [Cohen's *d*](./statistical-tables/powerd.md)
- [Snedecor's *F*](./statistical-tables/F.md)
- [*Eta-Squared*](./statistical-tables/powereta.md)
- [Tukey's *HSD*](./statistical-tables/hsd.md)

### APA Style

This chapter describes rules for presenting statistical results in APA style. All rules come from the newest APA style manual. Sample data tables are provided for more complex examples.

- [Summary of Parametric Statistic Reporting](./apa-style/summary.md)
- [Examples of Results in Tables](./apa-style/tables.md)

### Worked Examples

This chapter provides a set of worked examples. The raw data, typical computer output, and complete calculations are provided for each type of research design. All calculations are summarized in mini-Results sections using the APA style rules above.
