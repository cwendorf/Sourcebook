### Annotated Output

This chapter is intended to facilitate the connection between standard introductory statistics concepts and their implementation in JASP. It shows the output from various types of analyses, describes how to interpret the output, and shows the link between hand calculation formulas and JASP output. Results derive from the examples in the previous chapter of this project.

### Blank Output

This chapter is used as worksheets for class problems. Students fill in their answers on these sheets, thus making clear the links between non-computer (“hand”) calculations and the JASP output.
