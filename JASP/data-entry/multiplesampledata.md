## JASP: Data Entry

### Multiple Sample Data 

#### Entering Data (Using a Spreadsheet)

1. In the first row, type the names of the variables you wish to analyze. One variable will represent the Factor (Independent Variable) and the other will represent the Outcome (Dependent) Variable.

2. Enter the data for all of the participants. Notice that each participant has scores on both the Factor and Outcome Variables. There will be as many rows as people. 

3. On the categorical Factor, use the group number as the value for the individual.

4. If your data set has more than two groups, simply be sure to add a group indicator and a score for each additional person.
