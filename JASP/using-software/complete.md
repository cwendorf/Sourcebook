### Entering One Sample Data 

#### Steps for Entering Data on One Variable (Using a Spreadsheet)

1. In the first row and first 
cell, type the name of the 
outcome variable you wish
to analyze.

2. Enter the data in the
individual cells of the
column for the variable. 
Note that each cell should 
contain a single score for 
an individual person.
There will be as many rows 
as people. 

3. When saving the file, be 
sure to save it as a CSV 
(comma delimited) file.

#### Steps for Entering Data on One Variable (Using a Text Editor)

4. In the first row, type the 
 name of the outcome variable 
 you wish to analyze. 

5. Enter the data in separate 
 rows. Note that each row 
 should contain a single
 score for an individual
 person. There will be as 
 many rows as people. 

6. When saving the file, be 
 sure to save it as a CSV 
 (comma delimited) file.

### Entering Repeated Measures Data 

#### Steps for Entering Data (Using a Spreadsheet)

1. For repeated measures data,
 the columns represent the
 different instances of the 
 within-subjects variable. In 
 the example here, each 
 column is a measurement of 
 the same outcome variable
 (with the first row labeled
 accordingly).

2. Notice that each participant 
 has scores on both 
 variables. In this example,
 each of the five 
 participants has a score for 
 Outcome1 and for Outcome2. 

3. When saving the file, be 
 sure to save it as a CSV 
 (comma delimited) file.

4. For repeated measures data,
 the columns represent the
 different instances of the 
 within-subjects variable. In 
 the example here, each 
 column is a measurement of 
 the same outcome variable
 (with the first row labeled
 accordingly).

5. Notice that each participant 
 has scores on both 
 variables. In this example,
 each of the five 
 participants has a score for 
 Outcome1 and for Outcome2. 

6. When saving the file, be

### Entering Multiple Sample Data 

#### Steps for Entering Data (Using a Spreadsheet)

1. In the first row, type the 
names of the variables you 
wish to analyze. One 
variable will represent
the Factor (Independent
Variable) and the other
will represent the Outcome 
(Dependent) Variable.

2. Enter the data for all of
the participants. Notice 
that each participant has
scores on both the Factor
and Outcome Variables. 
There will be as many rows 
as people. 

3. On the categorical Factor, 
use the group number as
the value for the
individual.

4. If your data set has more
than two groups, simply be 
sure to add a group
indicator and a score for
each additional person.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image5.png"></kbd></p>

#### Steps for Entering Data (Using a Text Editor)

5. In the first row, type the 
 names of the variables you 
 wish to analyze (with names
 separated by commas). One
 variable will represent the
 Factor (Independent
 Variable) and the other will 
 represent the Outcome
 (Dependent) Variable.

6. Enter the data for all of
 the participants. Notice 
 that each participant has
 scores on both the Factor
 and Outcome Variables (with
 values separated by commas). 
 There will be as many rows 
 as people. 

7. On the categorical Factor, 
 use the group number as the
 value for the individual.

8. If your data set has more
 than two groups, simply be 
 sure to add a group
 indicator and a score for
 each additional person.

### Entering Factorial Data 

#### Steps for Entering Data (Using a Spreadsheet)

1. In the first row, type the 
 names of the variables you 
 wish to analyze. You should
 represent the Factors
 (Independent Variables) and
 the Outcome (Dependent)
 Variable.

2. Enter the scores for each of 
 the same participants on the 
 new variables. Notice that 
 each individual (i.e., the 
 rows) will still have values 
 for each variable (i.e., the 
 columns).

3. On the categorical Factors,
 note that the combination of 
 values in the Factors will 
 define the multiple groups 
 of the factorial design. 

4. When saving the file, be 
 sure to save it as a CSV 
 (comma delimited) file.

### Repeated Measures ANOVA 

#### Steps for Obtaining Repeated Measures Inferential Statistics

 measures data file that you
 previously created 
 (described elsewhere). Be
 sure that the data file
 looks as you intended. 

2. Select the "ANOVA → Repeated 
 Measures ANOVA" option.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image27.png"></kbd></p>

#### Steps for Labeling the Within-Subjects Variable/Factor

3. A set of options will then 
 appear for you to choose the 
 variables and statistics of
 interest.

4. In the "Repeated Measures
 Factors" box, you will 
 define the repeated measures 
 factor. This box is
 necessary for labeling the 
 repeated measurements of the 
 same underlying factor.

5. Click on "RM Factor 1" and 
 type in the name you wish to 
 give to the repeated 
 measures factor. In this 
 example, the 
 measurements/columns reflect 
 quizzes at two different 
 times so "Time" is used as 
 the name.

6. Below that, click on "Level
 1" to type the name of the 
 individual level of the
 repeated measures factor.
 You may do the same for each 
 level. In this example, the
 quiz was given twice, so 
 there were only 2 levels of
 the factor.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image28.png"></kbd></p>

#### Steps for Obtaining the Significance Test

7. In the "Repeated Measures
 Cells" box, you will 
 indicate which 
 measurements/columns in the
 data set reflect the 
 instances of the repeated
 measurements.

8. Select the instances you 
 wish to associate with the 
 factor by clicking on them 
 and then arrow to move them. 
 In this example, "t1score" 
 reflects the first level of
 the factor and "t2score" 
 reflects the second level of 
 the factor.

9. Note that this factor only 
 exists in the computer's 
 memory. For examples,
 nowhere in the data set will 
 you see a variable called
 "Time."

10. Output will automatically
 appear on the right side of
 the window. Output can be
 copied and pasted into other 
 documents for printing.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image29.png"></kbd></p>

#### Steps for Obtaining Additional Statistics

11. Though some basic summary
 statistics are displayed by
 default, you can make
 changes by expanding the 
 "Additional Options" 
 drop-down menu.

12. Select options that are
 important for you: 
 "Estimates of effect size" 
 will display the chosen
 statistics; and "Descriptive 
 statistics" will offer means 
 and standard deviations for
 each group.

13. Updated output will
 automatically appear on the
 right side of the window.
 Output can be copied and 
 pasted into other documents
 for printing.

 variables and statistics of
 interest.

4. Select the outcome variable
 and click the arrow to move
 it into the "Dependent 
 Variable" box. 

5. Move the multiple Factors
 (Independent Variables) to 
 the "Fixed Factors" box. 
 (The interaction term will 
 be automatically generated 
 in the output.)

6. Output will automatically
 appear on the right side of
 the window. Output can be
 copied and pasted into other 
 documents for printing.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image32.png"></kbd></p>

#### Steps for Obtaining Additional Statistics

7. Though some basic summary
 statistics are displayed by
 default, you can make
 changes by expanding the 
 "Additional Options" 
 drop-down menu.

8. Move the factors 
 (Independent Variable) name
 from the left-hand box for 
 "Marginal means" to the
 right-hand box. (If you wish 
 cell means for the factorial 
 design, be sure to move the
 interaction term as well.) 

9. Select options that are
 important for you: 
 "Estimates of effect size" 
 will display the chosen
 statistics; and "Descriptive 
 statistics" will offer means 
 and standard deviations for
 each group.
