### Repeated Measures ANOVA 

#### Steps for Obtaining Repeated Measures Inferential Statistics

1. First, load the repeated 
 measures data file that you
 previously created 
 (described elsewhere). Be
 sure that the data file
 looks as you intended. 

2. Select the "ANOVA â†’ Repeated 
 Measures ANOVA" option.

#### Steps for Labeling the Within-Subjects Variable/Factor

3. A set of options will then 
 appear for you to choose the 
 variables and statistics of
 interest.

4. In the "Repeated Measures
 Factors" box, you will 
 define the repeated measures 
 factor. This box is
 necessary for labeling the 
 repeated measurements of the 
 same underlying factor.

5. Click on "RM Factor 1" and 
 type in the name you wish to 
 give to the repeated 
 measures factor. In this 
 example, the 
 measurements/columns reflect 
 quizzes at two different 
 times so "Time" is used as 
 the name.

6. Below that, click on "Level
 1" to type the name of the 
 individual level of the
 repeated measures factor.
 You may do the same for each 
 level. In this example, the
 quiz was given twice, so 
 there were only 2 levels of
 the factor.

#### Steps for Obtaining the Significance Test

7. In the "Repeated Measures
 Cells" box, you will 
 indicate which 
 measurements/columns in the
 data set reflect the 
 instances of the repeated
 measurements.

8. Select the instances you 
 wish to associate with the 
 factor by clicking on them 
 and then arrow to move them. 
 In this example, "t1score" 
 reflects the first level of
 the factor and "t2score" 
 reflects the second level of 
 the factor.

9. Note that this factor only 
 exists in the computer's 
 memory. For examples,
 nowhere in the data set will 
 you see a variable called
 "Time."

10. Output will automatically
 appear on the right side of
 the window. Output can be
 copied and pasted into other 
 documents for printing.

#### Steps for Obtaining Additional Statistics

11. Though some basic summary
 statistics are displayed by
 default, you can make
 changes by expanding the 
 "Additional Options" 
 drop-down menu.

12. Select options that are
 important for you: 
 "Estimates of effect size" 
 will display the chosen
 statistics; and "Descriptive 
 statistics" will offer means 
 and standard deviations for
 each group.

13. Updated output will
 automatically appear on the
 right side of the window.
 Output can be copied and 
 pasted into other documents
 for printing.
