### Obtaining the Correlations (and Significance Tests)

3. A set of options will then appear for you to choose the variables and statistics of interest.

4. Select the variables you wish to analyze by clicking on them in the left-hand box and then the arrow to move them into the right-hand box. 

5. Output (with no descriptive statistics) will automatically appear on the right side of the window. Output can be copied and pasted into other software for printing.

6. If you wish descriptive statistics associated with each variable, follow the "Descriptives" procedures described earlier in this manual.
