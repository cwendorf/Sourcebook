### Obtaining Inferential Statistics

3. A set of options will then appear for you to choose the variables and statistics of interest.

4. Select the variable you wish to analyze by clicking on it in the left-hand box and then the arrow to move it into the right-hand box. 

5. Be sure to enter a known or hypothesized mean into the "Test Value" field. If you do not enter a value here, JASP will automatically use zero as the comparison mean.

6. Output will automatically appear on the right side of the window.

### Obtaining Additional Statistics

7. Select the options that are important for you: "Location parameter" will display the size of the difference between the two means; "Effect size" will display Cohen's d; and "Descriptives" will offer a mean and standard deviation for the group. 

8. If you wish to view (and alter) the widths of the confidence intervals, check the relevant "Confidence Interval" boxes. 

9. Updated output will automatically appear on the right side of the window.
