## Statistical Methods: Reporting Statistics

### Examples of APA Style Results in the Text

**Frequency Information:** Though not often reported, simple summary statistics – like the median and quartiles – provide the reader with basic frequency information about the variable under investigation.Both of the following versions present the required information.

> For the participants (*N* = 8), Outcome scores of 0.75, 4.00, and 6.50 represented the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles, respectively.

> The eight participants had a *Mdn* Outcome score of 4.00 (*IQR* = 0.75 – 6.50).

**Descriptive Statistics:** The purpose of the descriptive statistics is to provide the reader with an idea about the basic elements of the group(s) being studied. Note that this also forms the basis of the in-text presentation of descriptive statistics for other inferential analyses. Both of the following versions present the required information.

> The participants (*N* = 8) had a low mean Outcome score (*M* = 4.00, *SD* = 3.12).

> The eight participants had a mean Outcome of 4.00 (*SD* = 3.12).

**Correlations:** Correlations provide a measure of statistical relationship between two variables. Note that correlations can be tested for statistical significance (and that this information should be summarized if it is available and of interest).

> For the participants (*N* = 4), the scores on Outcome 1 (*M* = 2.00, *SD* = 2.45) and Outcome 2 (*M* = 6.00, *SD* = 2.45) were moderately correlated, *r*(2) = .50

> For the participants (*N* = 4), the scores on Outcome 1 (*M* = 2.00, *SD* = 2.45) and Outcome 2 (*M* = 6.00, *SD* = 2.45) were moderately but not statistically significantly correlated, *r*(2) = .50, *p* = .500.

**Confidence Intervals:** Confidence intervals provide a range estimate for a population value (e.g., the mean). Note that the width of the interval can be altered to reflect the level of confidence in the estimate. Both of the following versions present the required information.

> The participants (N = 8) had a mean Outcome score of 4.00 (SD = 3.12), 95% CI [1.39, 6.61].

> The 8 participants scored well on the Outcome (M = 4.00, SD = 3.12), 95% CI [1.39, 6.61].

**One Sample t Test:** In this case, a sample mean has been compared to a user-specified test value (or a population mean). Thus, the summary and the inferential statistics focus on that difference.

> A one sample *t* test showed that the difference in Outcome scores between the current sample (*N* = 8, *M* = 4.00, *SD* = 3.12) and the hypothesized value (7.00) was statistically significant, *t*(7) = -2.72, *p* = .030, 95% CI [-5.61, -.39], *d* = -0.96.

**Paired Samples t Test:** In this case, the differences between two measurements on one set of people are being compared. Thus, the summary and the inferential statistics focus on that difference.

> A paired samples *t* test showed that, for the four people, the difference in Outcome scores between the first time point (*M* = 2.00, *SD* = 2.45) and second time point (*M* = 6.00, *SD* = 2.45) was statistically significant, *t*(3) = -3.27, *p* = .047, 95% CI [-7.90, -0.10], *d* = -1.63.

**Independent Samples t Test:** For this analysis, the emphasis is on comparing the means from two groups. Here again the summary and the inferential statistics focus on the difference.

> An independent samples *t* test showed that the difference in Outcome scores between the first group (*n* = 4, *M* = 4.00, *SD* = 2.45) and the second group (*n* = 3, *M* = 6.00, *SD* = 2.45) was not statistically significant, *t*(6) = -2.31, *p* = .060, 95% CI [-8.24, 0.24], *d* = -1.63.

**One Way ANOVA:** The ANOVA provides an omnibus test of the differences across multiple groups. Because the ANOVA tests the overall differences among the groups, the text discusses the differences only in general.

> A one way ANOVA showed that the differences in Outcome scores between the first group (*n* = 3, *M* = 2.00, *SD* = 2.45), the second group (*n* = 3, *M* = 6.00, *SD* = 2.45), and the third group (*n* = 3, *M* = 7.00, *SD* = 2.45) were statistically significant, *F*(2,9) = 4.67, *p* = .041, *eta*<sup>2</sup> = .51.

**One Way ANOVA with Post Hoc Tests:** Post hoc tests build on the ANOVA results and provide a more focused comparison among the groups. Notice that the post hoc summary duplicates the presentation of the omnibus ANOVA statistics.

> A one way ANOVA showed that the differences in Outcome scores between the first group (*n* = 3, *M* = 2.00, *SD* = 2.45), the second group (*n* = 3, *M* = 6.00, *SD* = 2.45), and the third group (*n* = 3, *M* = 7.00, *SD* = 2.45) were statistically significant, *F*(2,9) = 4.67, *p* = .041, *eta*<sup>2</sup> = .51. Tukey's HSD tests showed that only the third group scored statistically significantly different than the first group. However, the other comparisons were not statistically significant.

**Repeated Measures ANOVA:** The RMD ANOVA tests for overall differences across the repeated measures. As such, its summary parallels that of the One Way ANOVA.

> A repeated measures ANOVA showed that the difference in Outcome scores (*N* = 4) between the first time point (*M* = 2.00, *SD* = 2.45) and second time point (*M* = 6.00, *SD* = 2.45) was statistically significant, *F*(1,3) = 10.67, *p* = .047, partial *eta*<sup>2</sup> = .78.

**Factorial ANOVA:** The factorial ANOVA provides statistics for all of the main effects and interactions in a factorial design. Each effect would be summarized in a style analogous to a One Way ANOVA.

> A 2 (Factor A) x 2 (Factor B) ANOVA was conducted on the Outcome scores. Neither Factor A, *F*(1,12) = 0.67, *p* = .430, partial *eta*<sup>2</sup> = .05, nor Factor B, *F*(1,12) = 2.67, *p* = .128, partial *eta*<sup>2</sup> = .18, had a statistically significant impact on the Outcome. However, the interaction was statistically significant, *F*(1,12) = 6.00, *p* = .031, partial *eta*<sup>2</sup> = .33.
