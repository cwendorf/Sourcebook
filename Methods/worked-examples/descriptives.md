### Descriptives

#### Data for the Descriptive Statistics

The following data set reflects one sample of eight individuals measured on one variable. The data are presented in the format suitable for entry into statistical software.

|     | Outcome |
|-----|---------|
| 1   | .00     |
| 2   | .00     |
| 3   | 3.00    |
| 4   | 5.00    |
| 5   | 4.00    |
| 6   | 7.00    |
| 7   | 4.00    |
| 8   | 9.00    |

The following frequency distribution can be used to determine the descriptive statistics.

|     |   | Frequency | Percent | Valid Percent | Cumulative Percent |
|-------|-----------|---------|---------------|--------------------|-------|
| Valid | 0.00      | 2       | 25.0          | 25.0               | 25.0  |
|       | 3.00      | 1       | 12.5          | 12.5               | 37.5  |
|       | 4.00      | 2       | 25.0          | 25.0               | 62.5  |
|       | 5.00      | 1       | 12.5          | 12.5               | 75.0  |
|       | 7.00      | 1       | 12.5          | 12.5               | 87.5  |
|       | 9.00      | 1       | 12.5          | 12.5               | 100.0 |
|       | Total     | 8       | 100.0         | 100.0              |       |

#### Calculating the Descriptive Statistics

**Mean:** The mean (or arithmetic average) is calculated as an unbiased estimate of the population mean. Here, the mean is determined as the average of the scores weighted by their frequencies:

> *M* = SUM (f*Y*) / *N* = [ ( 2 x 0 ) + ( 1 x 3 ) + ( 2 x 4 ) + ( 1 x 5 ) + ( 1 x 7 ) + (1  x 8) ] / 8 = 4.000

**Sum of Squares:** The Sum of Squares is the basic measure of the variability of the scores. Formally, it is the sum of the weighted deviations of the scores about the mean.

> *SS* = SUM ( f ( Y - M )) = 2 ( 0 - 4.000 )<sup>2</sup> + 1 ( 3 - 4.000 )<sup>2</sup> + 2 ( 4 - 4.000 )<sup>2</sup> + 1 ( 5 - 4.000 )<sup>2</sup> + 1 ( 7 - 4.000 )<sup>2</sup> + 1 ( 8 - 4.000 )<sup>2</sup> = 68.000

**Mean Squares:** Mean Squares (also known as Variance) is a function of the Sum of Squares. It is calculated as an unbiased estimate of the population variance.

> *MS* = (*SS*) / (*N* - 1) = (68) / (7) = 9.714

**Standard Deviation:** Standard Deviation is a function of the Mean Squares. It is also calculated as an unbiased estimate of the population standard deviation.

> *SD* = SQRT ( *MS* ) = SQRT ( 9.714 ) = 3.117

> \\[ SD = \SQRT(MS) = \SQRT(9.714) = 3.117 \\]

#### Summarizing the Descriptive Statistics

The purpose of the descriptive statistics is to provide the reader with an idea about the basic elements of the group(s) being studied. Note that these also form the basis of the in-text presentation for most statistical analyses. Both of the following versions present the required information.

> The participants (*N* = 8) had a low mean Outcome score (*M* = 4.00, *SD* = 3.12).

> The eight participants had a mean Outcome of 4.00 (*SD* = 3.12).

Alternatively, sample sizes, means, and standard deviations could be presented in a table or figure associated with this paragraph.
