#### Obtaining the Statistics

6. To get the confidence interval for the mean, make sure the “Test Value” is set to zero.

7. Check the “Confidence Interval” box (and alter the width of the interval if desired). 

8. Similarly, select other options that are important for you: “Descriptives” will offer a mean and standard deviation for the variable; and “Descriptives plots” will provide a graph of the confidence interval.

9. Updated output will automatically appear on the right side of the window. Output can be copied and pasted into other documents for printing.
