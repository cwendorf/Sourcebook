## Independent Samples t Test 

### Obtaining Two Sample Inferential Statistics

3. A set of options will then appear for you to choose the variables and statistics of interest.

4. Select the outcome variable and click the arrow to move it into the "Dependent Variables" box.

5. Move the Independent Variable to the "Grouping Variable" box. 

6. Output will automatically appear on the right side of the window. Output can be copied and pasted into other software for printing.

### Obtaining Additional Statistics

7. If you wish to view (and alter) the width of the confidence interval, check the "Confidence Interval" box. 

8. Similarly, select other options that are important for you: "Mean Difference" will display the size of the difference between the two group's means; "Effect size" will display Cohen's d; and "Descriptives" will offer means and standard deviations for each group. 

9. Updated output will automatically appear on the right side of the window. Output can be copied and pasted into other software for printing.
