## Paired Samples t Test

### Obtaining Paired Sample Inferential Statistics

1. First, enter paired samples or repeated measures data (described elsewhere). 

2. On the "Analysis" tab, Select the "T-Tests â†’ Paired Samples T-Test" option.

### Obtaining the Significance Test

3. A set of options will then appear for you to choose the variables and statistics of interest.

4. Select the variables you wish to analyze by clicking on both of them while holding down the "CTRL" key. Then click on the arrow to move the pair of variables to the righthand box.

5. Output will automatically appear on the right side of the window. Output can be copied and pasted into other software for printing.

### Obtaining Additional Statistics 

6. If you wish to view (and alter) the width of the confidence interval, check the "Confidence Interval" box. 

7. Similarly, select other options that are important for you: "Mean Difference" will display the size of the difference between the two means; "Effect size" will display Cohen's d; and "Descriptives" will offer means and standard deviations for each variable.

8. Updated output will automatically appear on the right side of the window. Output can be copied and pasted into other software for printing.
