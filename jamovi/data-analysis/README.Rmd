# jamovi | Data Analysis

## Descriptives (Frequencies and Descriptives) 

### Obtaining Frequency-Related Statistics

1. First, enter the data (described elsewhere). 

2. On the "Analyses" tab, select the "Exploration -> Descriptives" option.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="descriptives1.png"></kbd></p>

### Obtaining a Frequency Distribution

3. A set of options will then appear for you to choose the variables and statistics of interest.

4. Select the variables you wish to analyze by clicking on them in the lefthand box and then the arrow to move them into the righthand box.

5. Be sure that "Frequency tables" is checked. Without this checked, you will not get a frequency distribution.

6. Output will automatically appear on the right side of the window. 

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="descriptives2.png"></kbd></p>

### Obtaining Summary Statistics

7. Though some basic summary statistics are displayed by default, you can make changes by expanding the "Statistics" dropdown menu.

8. As you select the desired statistics, the output on the right side of the window will be automatically updated. 

9. Individual tables (or even the whole section of Output) can be copied using the dropdown arrow options in the output. These can be pasted into other word processing software for printing purposes.

## Correlations (Bivariate) 

### Obtaining Correlational Statistics 

1. First, enter data involving multiple variables (described elsewhere). 

2. On the "Analyses" tab, select the "Regression -> Correlation Matrix" option.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="correlations1.png"></kbd></p>

### Obtaining Correlations (and Significance Tests)

3. A set of options will then appear for you to choose the variables and statistics of interest.

4. Select the variables you wish to analyze by clicking on them in the lefthand box and then the arrow to move them into the righthand box.

5. Output (with no descriptive statistics) will automatically appear on the right side of the window. Output can be copied and pasted into other software for printing.

6. If you wish descriptive statistics associated with each variable, follow the "Descriptives" p procedures described earlier in this manual.

## Compute (Transformations and Standardized Scores)

### Obtaining the Compute Menu

1. First, enter the data (described elsewhere).

2. After the data are entered, click on the column representing the data you wish to transform.

3. Select the “Compute” option from the menu. This will bring up a new set of options.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="standardized1.png"></kbd></p>

### Computing Transformations

4. Type in the new you wish to give the new variable (here it is “trOutcome).

5. Click on the “fx” button to obtain the dropdown menu.  

6. Click on the variable you wish to transform (“Outcome”). This will place it in the formula editor. Then add, subtract, multiply, or divide as needed to get the transformation you want.

7. Hit “Enter” on your keyboard to perform the data transformation.

8. To hide the setup menu, click on the large UP arrow button to the right of the variable name.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="standardized2.png"></kbd></p>

### Viewing the Transformed Scores

9. Note that transformed variables are not included in the output. Rather, they are saved as new variables in the data view window. 

10.	These variables can be used in subsequent analyses. You can follow the previous tutorials to get descriptive statistics for these variables.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="standardized3.png"></kbd></p>

### Obtaining Standardized Scores

11.	In addition, you can obtain standardized scores. First, enter the data (described elsewhere).

12.	After the data are entered, click on the column representing the data you wish to transform.

13.	Select the “Compute” option from the menu. This will bring up a new set of options.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="standardized4.png"></kbd></p>

### Computing Standardized Scores

14.	Type in the new you wish to give the new variable (here it is “zOutcome).

15.	Click on the “fx” button to obtain the dropdown menu.  On the left side under functions, click on “z” to place it in the formula editor.

16.	Click on the variable you wish to transform (“Outcome”). This will place it in the formula editor. 

17.	Hit “Enter” on your keyboard to perform the data transformation.

18.	To hide the setup menu, click on the large UP arrow button to the right of the variable name.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="standardized5.png"></kbd></p>

### Viewing the Standardized Scores

19.	Note that transformed variables are not included in the output. Rather, they are saved as new variables in the data view window. 

20.	These variables can be used in subsequent analyses. You can follow the previous tutorials to get descriptive statistics for these variables.
