#### Obtaining Additional Statistics

6. Be sure to enter a known or
hypothesized mean into the 
"Test Value" field. If you 
do not enter a value here, 
jamovi will automatically
use zero as the comparison 
mean.

7. If you wish to view (and 
alter) the width of the
confidence interval, check 
the "Confidence Interval"
box. 

8. Similarly, select other
options that are important 
for you: "Mean Difference" 
will display the size of 
the difference between the 
two means; "Effect size" 
will display Cohen's d;
and "Descriptives" will
offer a mean and standard
deviation for the group. 

9. Updated output will
automatically appear on
the right side of the
window. Output can be
copied and pasted into 
other documents for
printing.
