## **Entering One Sample Data**

### **Steps for Defining Variables**

1. First, click on the "Data" tab on the top of the window. Generally speaking, this is where you will enter the data for all of the variables in the data set. 

2. Click on a cell in the column (i.e., variable) that you wish to define. Click on "Setup" from the menu. This will bring up a new set of options.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image1.jpg"></kbd></p>

### **Steps for Setting Variable Properties**

3. Type in the name of the variable in the top box (previously labeled "A").

4. Define the level of measurement for the variables by choosing the appropriate option. In this example, "Outcome" (an outcome variable) is continuous.

5. To hide the setup menu, click on the large UP arrow button to the right of the variable name.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image2.jpg"></kbd></p>

### **Steps for Entering Data**

6. Enter the data in the individual cells of the
column for the variable. Note that each cell should contain a single score for an individual person. There will be as many rows as people. 

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image3.jpg"></kbd></p>

## **Entering Repeated Measures Data**

### **Steps for Defining Variables** 

1. First, click on the "Data" tab on the top of the window. Generally speaking, this is where you will enter the data for all of the variables in the data set. 

2. Click on a cell in the column (i.e., variable) that you wish to define. Click on "Setup" from the menu. This will bring up a new set of options. 

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image1.jpg"></kbd></p>

### **Steps for Setting Variable Properties**

3. Type in the name of the variable in the top box (previously labeled "A").

4. Define the level of measurement for the variables by choosing the appropriate option. In this example, "Outcome1" (an instance of the outcome variable) is continuous. 

5. To hide the setup menu, click on the large UP arrow button to the right of the variable name. 

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image4.jpg"></kbd></p>

### **Steps for Entering Data**

6. Enter the data in the individual cells of the column for the variable. Note that each cell should contain a single score for an individual person. There will be as many rows as
people.

7. Notice that each individual (i.e., the rows) have values 
for each instance of the within-subjects variable (i.e., the columns).

## **Entering Multiple Sample Data** 

### **Steps for Defining Variables**

1. First, click on the "Data" 
tab on the top of the
window. Generally speaking,
this is where you will enter 
the data for all of the
variables in the data set. 

2. Click on a cell in the 
column (i.e., variable) that 
you wish to define. Click on 
"Setup" from the menu. This
will bring up a new set of 
options. 

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image6.jpg"></kbd></p>

### **Steps for Setting Variable Properties**

3. You will need to define
multiple variables. One
variable will represent the
Factor (Independent
Variable) and the other will 
represent the Outcome
(Dependent) Variable.

4. Provide a name and define
the level of measurement for 
the variables by choosing
the appropriate options. In
this example, "Factor" 
(Independent Variable) is
nominal. The "Outcome" 
(Dependent) variable is
continuous.

5. To hide the setup menu,
click on the large UP arrow
button next to the variable
name.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image7.jpg"></kbd></p>

### **Steps for Entering Data**

6. Enter the data for all of
the participants. Notice 
that each participant has
scores on both the Factor
and Outcome Variables. There 
will be as many rows as
people.

7. On the categorical "Factor", 
you will use numbers to
represent the two categories 
(or "levels") of the 
variable.

8. If your data set has more
than two groups, simply be 
sure to add a group
indicator (a value on the
"Factor" variable) and a 
"Outcome" for each 
additional person.

## **Entering Factorial Data** 

### **Steps for Defining Variables**

1. First, click on the "Data" 
tab on the top of the
window. Generally speaking,
this is where you will enter 
the data for all of the
variables in the data set. 

2. Click on a cell in the 
column (i.e., variable) that 
you wish to define. Click on 
"Setup" from the menu. This
will bring up a new set of 
options. 

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image6.jpg"></kbd></p>

### **Steps for Setting Variable Properties**

3. You will need to define
multiple variables. Two
variables will represent the 
Factors (Independent 
Variables) and the other 
will represent the Outcome 
(Dependent) Variable.

4. Provide a name and define
the level of measurement for 
the variables by choosing
the appropriate options. In
this example, "FactorA" and
"FactorB" nominal. The 
"Outcome" (Dependent)
variable is continuous.

5. To hide the setup menu,
click on the large UP arrow
button next to the variable
name.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image9.jpg"></kbd></p>

### **Steps for Entering Data**
 
6. Enter the data for all of
the participants. Notice 
that each participant has
scores on both of the
Factors and on the Outcome 
Variable. There will be as 
many rows as people. 

7. On the categorical Factors,
use the values that you
indicated when defining the
variables earlier. Note that 
the combination of values in 
the Factors will define the
multiple groups of the 
factorial design.

8. If your data set has more
than two levels for either 
(or both) of the Factors,
simply be sure to add an 
indicator and an outcome 
value for each additional
person.
