3. A set of options will then 
appear for you to choose 
the variables and
statistics of interest.

4. Select the variables you 
wish to analyze by 
clicking on them in the
lefthand box and then the 
arrow to move them into
the righthand box.

5. Output (with no descriptive
statistics) will 
automatically appear on
the right side of the
window. Output can be
copied and pasted into 
other documents for
printing.

6. If you wish descriptive
statistics associated with 
each variable, follow the
"Descriptives" procedures
