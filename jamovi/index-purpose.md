## [jamovi Articles](./index-purpose.md)

This index page provides links to the various materials available for using jamovi to analyze examples. For teaching a statistics course, [the main index](./index.md) organizes the materials by topic (e.g., One Sample t Test, ANOVA, etc.) rather than by the goals of the page (i.e., Data Entry, Data Analysis, Annotated Output).

### Data Entry

This chapter provides step-by-step written instructions and screenshots showing how to enter the data using the software. Sample data files are available.

- [Data Entry \| One Sample Data](./data-entry/onesample.md)  
- [Data Entry \| Paired and Repeated Measures Data](./data-entry/repeated.md)
- [Data Entry \| Two and Multiple Sample Data](./data-entry/multisample.md)
- [Data Entry \| Factorial Data](./data-entry/factorial.md)

### Data Analysis

This chapter provides step-by-step written instructions and screenshots for obtaining basic statistical output using the software.

- [Data Analysis \| Frequencies](./data-analysis/frequencies.md)
- [Data Analysis \| Descriptives](./data-analysis/descriptives.md)
- [Data Analysis \| Standardized Scores](./data-analysis/standardized.md)
- [Data Analysis \| Correlations](./data-analysis/correlations.md)
- [Data Analysis \| Regression](./data-analysis/regression.md)
- [Data Analysis \| Confidence Interval for a Mean](./data-analysis/intervals.md)
- [Data Analysis \| One Sample t Test](./data-analysis/onesample.md)
- [Data Analysis \| Paired Samples t Test](./data-analysis/paired.md)
- [Data Analysis \| Independent Samples t Test](./data-analysis/independent.md)
- [Data Analysis \| OneWay ANOVA](./data-analysis/oneway.md)
- [Data Analysis \| Post Hoc Comparisons](./data-analysis/posthocs.md)
- [Data Analysis \| Repeated Measures ANOVA](./data-analysis/repeated.md)
- [Data Analysis \| Factorial ANOVA](./data-analysis/factorial.md)

### Annotated Output

This chapter shows the output from various types of analyses, describes how to interpret the output, and shows the link between hand calculation formulas and the output. Sample output files are available.

- [Annotated Output \| Frequencies](./annotated-output/frequencies.md)
- [Annotated Output \| Descriptives](./annotated-output/descriptives.md)
- [Annotated Output \| Standardized Scores](./annotated-output/standardized.md)
- [Annotated Output \| Correlations](./annotated-output/correlations.md)
- [Annotated Output \| Regression](./annotated-output/regression.md)
- [Annotated Output \| Confidence Interval for a Mean](./annotated-output/intervals.md)
- [Annotated Output \| One Sample t Test](./annotated-output/onesample.md)
- [Annotated Output \| Paired Samples t Test](./annotated-output/paired.md)
- [Annotated Output \| Independent Samples t Test](./annotated-output/independent.md)
- [Annotated Output \| OneWay ANOVA](./annotated-output/oneway.md)
- [Annotated Output \| Post Hoc Comparisons](./annotated-output/posthocs.md)
- [Annotated Output \| Repeated Measures ANOVA](./annotated-output/repeated.md)
- [Annotated Output \| Factorial ANOVA](./annotated-output/factorial.md)
