## Understanding jamovi 

### Using the Software

This chapter provides step-by-step instructions on how to obtain basic statistical output using jamovi, both visually with screenshots and via written instructions. Simple examples for most undergraduate level between-subjects and within-subjects research designs are provided.

### Annotated Output

This chapter is intended to facilitate the connection between standard introductory statistics concepts and their implementation in jamovi. It shows the output from various types of analyses, describes how to interpret the output, and shows the link between hand calculation formulas and jamovi output.

### Blank Output

This chapter is used as worksheets for class problems. Students fill in their answers on these sheets, thus making clear the links between non-computer (“hand”) calculations and the jamovi output.
