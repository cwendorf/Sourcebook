## Data Entry | One Sample Data

### Defining Variables

1. First, click on the "Data" tab on the top of the window. Generally speaking, this is where you will enter the data for all of the variables in the data set. 

2. Click on a cell in the column (i.e., variable) that you wish to define. Click on "Setup" from the menu. This will bring up a new set of options.

4. Define the level of measurement for the variables by choosing the appropriate option. In this example, "Outcome" (an outcome variable) is continuous.

5. To hide the setup menu, click on the large UP arrow button to the right of the variable name.
