## Post Hoc Comparisons

Post hoc tests build on the ANOVA results and provide a more focused comparison among the groups and usually follows a presentation of the ANOVA (which already includes the descriptive information). The first example focuses on statistical significance testing, whereas as the second version includes and emphasizes interpretation of the confidence intervals (and can be presented on its own). 

> Tukey's HSD tests showed that the first group scored statistically significantly different than the third group, *t*(9) = -2.89, p = 043. However, the other comparisons were not statistically significant (*p*s > .05).

> A series of Tukey's HSD comparisons revealed that the first group (*n* = 3, *M* = 2.00, *SD* = 2.45) scored substantially lower Outcome scores than the third group (*n* = 3, *M* = 7.00, *SD* = 2.45), 95% CI [-9.84, -.16], *t*(9) = -2.89, p = 043. However, the other comparisons revealed effectively little to no difference between the other groups (*p*s > .05).

Alternatively, the means, standard deviations, and confidence intervals could be presented in a table or figure associated with this text.
