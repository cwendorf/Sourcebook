## Factorial ANOVA

The Factorial ANOVA provides statistics for the main effects and interactions in a factorial design. Each effect would be summarized in a style analogous to a One Way ANOVA. The first example focuses on statistical significance testing, whereas the second version includes and emphasizes interpretation of the effect size. 

> A 2 (Factor A) x 2 (Factor B) ANOVA showed that neither Factor A, *F*(1,12) = 0.67, *p* = .430, nor Factor B, *F*(1,12) = 2.67, *p* = .128, had a statistically significant impact on the Outcome. However, the interaction was statistically significant, *F*(1,12) = 6.00, *p* = .031.

> Analyses revealed that neither Factor A, partial *eta*<sup>2</sup> = .05, *F*(1,12) = 0.67, *p* = .430, nor Factor B, partial *eta*<sup>2</sup> = .18, *F*(1,12) = 2.67, *p* = .128, had an appreciable impact on the Outcome. However, the interaction had a large impact on the Outcome, partial *eta*<sup>2</sup> = .33, *F*(1,12) = 6.00, *p* = .031.

Typically, the means, standard deviations, and confidence intervals would be presented in a table or figure associated with this text.
