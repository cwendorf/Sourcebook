## Repeated Measures ANOVA

The RMD ANOVA tests for overall differences across the repeated measures. As such, its summary parallels that of the One Way ANOVA. The first example focuses on statistical significance testing, whereas the second version includes and emphasizes interpretation of the effect size. 

> A repeated measures ANOVA showed that the difference in Outcome scores (*N* = 4) between the first time point (*M* = 2.00, *SD* = 2.45) and second time point (*M* = 6.00, *SD* = 2.45) was statistically significant, *F*(1,3) = 10.67, *p* = .047, partial *eta*<sup>2</sup> = .78.

> Analyses revealed a substantial increase in Outcome scores (*N* = 4) from the first time point (*M* = 2.00, *SD* = 2.45) to the second time point (*M* = 6.00, *SD* = 2.45), partial *eta*<sup>2</sup> = .78, *F*(1,3) = 10.67, *p* = .047.

Alternatively, the means, standard deviations, and confidence intervals could be presented in a table or figure associated with this text.
