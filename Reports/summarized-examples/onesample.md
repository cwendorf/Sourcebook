## One Sample t Test

For this analysis, a sample mean has been compared to a user-specified test value (or a population mean). Thus, the summary and the inferential statistics focus on that difference. The first example focuses on statistical significance testing, whereas the second version includes and emphasizes interpretation of the confidence interval and effect size.

> A one sample *t* test showed that the difference in Outcome scores between the current sample (*N* = 8, *M* = 4.00, *SD* = 3.12) and the hypothesized value (7.00) was statistically significant, *t*(7) = -2.72, *p* = .030.

> Analyses revealed that the current sample (*N* = 8, *M* = 4.00, *SD* = 3.12) had dramatically higher Outcome scores than the hypothesized value (7.00), 95% CI [-5.61, -.39], *d* = -0.96, *t*(7) = -2.72, *p* = .030.
