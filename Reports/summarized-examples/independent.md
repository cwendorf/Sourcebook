## Independent Samples t Test

For this analysis, the emphasis is on comparing the means from two groups. Here again the summary and the inferential statistics focus on the difference. The first example focuses on statistical significance testing, whereas as the second version includes and emphasizes interpretation of the confidence interval and effect size. 

> An independent samples *t* test showed that the difference in Outcome scores between the first group (*n* = 4, *M* = 4.00, *SD* = 2.45) and the second group (*n* = 3, *M* = 6.00, *SD* = 2.45) was not statistically significant, *t*(6) = -2.31, *p* = .060, 95% CI [-8.24, 0.24], *d* = -1.63.

> Analyses revealed a potentially large, yet inconclusive, difference in Outcome scores between the first group (*n* = 4, *M* = 4.00, *SD* = 2.45) and the second group (*n* = 3, *M* = 6.00, *SD* = 2.45), 95% CI [-8.24, 0.24], *d* = -1.63, *t*(6) = -2.31, *p* = .060.

Alternatively, the means, standard deviations, and confidence intervals could be presented in a table or figure associated with this text.
