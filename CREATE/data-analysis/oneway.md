## Data Analysis | OneWay ANOVA

### Entering the Data 

1. From the available tabs, select "OneWay".

2. On the left side, you will be able to enter the data in the shaded cells.

3. Enter the data for all the participants. Notice that each participant has a score on both the Group and Outcome Variables. There will be as many rows as people. 

4. On the categorical Group variable, you will use numbers to represent the multiple categories (or “levels”) of the variable.
