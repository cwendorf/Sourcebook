## Data Analysis | Correlations

### Entering the Data 

1. From the available tabs, select "Correlations".

2. On the left side, you will be able to enter the data in the shaded cells.

3. Enter the data in the individual cells of the column for the variable. Note that each cell should contain a single score for an individual person. There will be as many rows as people.

4. Notice that each individual (i.e., the rows) has a value for each instance of the within-subjects variable (i.e., the columns).
