## [CREATE Articles](./index.md)

This index page provides links to the various materials available for using SPSS to analyze examples. [The original index](./index-original.md) organizes the materials by the goals of the pages (i.e, Data Analysis, Annotated Output) rather than by topic (e.g., One Sample t Test, ANOVA, etc.). 

### Frequencies

These pages show how to obtain and calculate frequency distributions and percentiles.

- Data Analysis: [Frequencies](./data-analysis/frequencies.md)
- Annotated Output: [Frequencies](./annotated-output/frequencies.md)

### Descriptives

These pages show how to obtain and calculate descriptive statistics such as the mean and standard deviation.

- Data Analysis: [Descriptives](./data-analysis/descriptives.md)
- Annotated Output: [Descriptives](./annotated-output/descriptives.md)

### Correlations

These pages show how to obtain and calculate correlations.

- Data Analysis: [Correlations](./data-analysis/correlations.md)
- Annotated Output: [Correlations](./annotated-output/correlations.md)

### Regression

These pages show how to obtain and calculate a regression model.

- Data Analysis: [Regression](./data-analysis/regression.md)
- Annotated Output: [Regression](./annotated-output/regression.md)

### Confidence Interval for a Mean

These pages show how to obtain and calculate a confidence interval for a mean.

- Data Analysis: [Confidence Interval for a Mean](./data-analysis/intervals.md)
- Annotated Output: [Confidence Interval for a Mean](./annotated-output/intervals.md)

### One Sample t Test

These pages show how to obtain and calculate statistical significance, an effect size, and a confidence interval for one sample.

- Data Analysis: [One Sample t Test](./data-analysis/onesample.md)
- Annotated Output: [One Sample t Test](./annotated-output/onesample.md)

### Paired Samples t Test

These pages show how to obtain and calculate statistical significance, an effect size, and a confidence interval for paired samples.

- Data Analysis: [Paired Samples t Test](./data-analysis/paired.md)
- Annotated Output: [Paired Samples t Test](./annotated-output/paired.md)

### Independent Samples t Test

These pages show how to obtain and calculate statistical significance, an effect size, and a confidence interval for two samples.

- Data Analysis: [Independent Samples t Test](./data-analysis/independent.md)
- Annotated Output: [Independent Samples t Test](./annotated-output/independent.md)

### OneWay ANOVA

These pages show how to obtain and calculate statistical significance, an effect size, and a confidence interval for multiple samples.

- Data Analysis: [OneWay ANOVA](./data-analysis/oneway.md)
- Annotated Output: [OneWay ANOVA](./annotated-output/oneway.md)

### Post Hoc Comparisons

These pages show how to obtain and calculate statistical significance, effect sizes, and confidence intervals for comparisons.

- Data Analysis: [Post Hoc Comparisons](./data-analysis/posthocs.md)
- Annotated Output: [Post Hoc Comparisons](./annotated-output/posthocs.md)

### Repeated Measures ANOVA

These pages show how to obtain and calculate statistical significance and an effect size for repeated measures.

- Data Analysis: [Repeated Measures ANOVA](./data-analysis/repeated.md)
- Annotated Output: [Repeated Measures ANOVA](./annotated-output/repeated.md)

### Factorial ANOVA

These pages show how to obtain and calculate statistical significance and an effect size for factorial design.
