# Topics | Introductory Statistics

### Objectives

These pages are designed to address the following learning outcomes for use of this Sourcebook in teaching an undergraduate statistics course.

- Input data into a software program (e.g, jamovi) for further analyses
- Choose and implement the appropriate analyses given the research design
- Demonstrate the connections between formulas, calculations, and computer output of analyses
- Summarize and interpret statistical analyses in correct APA style

### Material Listed by Topic

This chapter organizes the material by topic rather than by purpose.

- [Frequencies](./frequencies.md)
- [Descriptives](./descriptives.md)
- [Transformations and Standardized Scores](./standardized.md)
- [Correlations](./correlations.md)
- [Confidence Intervals](./intervals.md)
- [One Sample t Test](./onesample.md)
- [Paired Samples t Test](./paired.md)
- [Independent Samples t Test](./independent.md)
- [OneWay ANOVA](./oneway.md)
- [Post Hoc Comparisons](./posthocs.md)
- [Repeated Measures ANOVA](./repeated.md)
- [Factorial ANOVA](./factorial.md)

Readers who wish to use this Sourcebook to work sequentially through the topics of a typical undergraduate statistics course are encouraged to start in the special [**Topics**](./Topics) section (which focuses on the use of jamovi to teach a course).

### Worked Examples

This chapter provides a set of worked examples. The raw data, typical computer output, and complete calculations are provided for each type of research design.
