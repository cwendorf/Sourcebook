## Calculations: Descriptives

### Formulas 

Mean: The mean (or arithmetic average) is calculated as an unbiased estimate of the population mean. Here, the mean is determined as the average of the scores weighted by their frequencies:

> $$ M = \frac{\sum(fY)}{N} $$

Sum of Squares: The Sum of Squares is the basic measure of the variability of the scores. Formally, it is the sum of the weighted deviations of the scores about the mean.

> $$ SS = \sum f (Y - M) $$

Mean Squares: Mean Squares (also known as Variance) is a function of the Sum of Squares. It is calculated as an unbiased estimate of the population variance.

> $$ MS = \frac{SS}{(N - 1)} $$

Standard Deviation: Standard Deviation is a function of the Mean Squares. It is also calculated as an unbiased estimate of the population standard deviation.

> $$ SD = \sqrt{MS} $$
