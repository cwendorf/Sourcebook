## Correlations

### Preliminary Calculations

Sum of Cross Products: The Sum of Cross Products (SCP) is not easily determined solely from the summary statistics of the output, but rather from the data.

> $$ SCP = \sum ( X - M_X ) ( Y - M_Y ) $$

Covariance: The Covariance is a function of the Sum of Cross Products and the sample size:

> $$ COV = \frac{SCP}{(N - 1)} $$

### Primary Statistics

Pearson Correlation Coefficient: The Pearson Correlation Coefficient is a function of the Covariance and the Standard Deviations of both variables:

> $$ r = \frac{COV}{(SD_X) (SD_Y)} $$
