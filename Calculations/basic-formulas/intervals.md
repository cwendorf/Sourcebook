## Confidence Intervals

### Formulas

Standard Error of the Mean: The standard error of the mean provides an estimate of how spread out the distribution of all possible random sample means would be.

> $$ SE_M = \frac{SD}{\sqrt{N}} $$

Confidence Interval: For this test, the appropriate confidence interval is around (centered on) the mean difference (raw effect).

> $$ CI_M = M \pm (t_{CRITICAL}) (SE_M) $$
