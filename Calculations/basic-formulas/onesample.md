## One Sample t Test

### Formulas

Standard Error of the Mean: The standard error of the mean provides an estimate of how spread out the distribution of all possible random sample means would be.

> $$ SE_M = \frac{SD}{\sqrt{N}} $$

Mean Difference (Raw Effect): The Mean Difference is the difference between the sample mean and a user-specified test value or population mean.

> $$ M_{DIFF} = M - \mu $$

Statistical Significance: The *t* statistic is the ratio of the mean difference (raw effect) to the standard error of the mean.

> $$ t = \frac{M_{DIFF}}{SE_M} $$

Confidence Interval: For this design, the appropriate confidence interval is around (centered on) the mean difference (raw effect).

> $$ CI_{DIFF} = M_{DIFF} \pm (t_{CRITICAL} ) (SE_M) $$

Effect Size: Cohenâ€™s *d* Statistic provides a standardized effect size for the mean difference (raw effect).

> $$ d = \frac{M_{DIFF}}{SD} $$
