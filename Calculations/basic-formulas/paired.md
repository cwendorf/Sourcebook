### Paired Samples t Test

#### Formulas

For the Paired Samples t test, the focus is on the change variable. As a result, it is the only variable that is used in the calculations below.

Mean Difference (Raw Effect): The Mean Difference is the difference between the sample mean and a user-specified test value or population mean.

> \\[ M_{DIFF} = M - \mu \\]

Statistical Significance: The *t* statistic is the ratio of the mean difference (raw effect) to the standard error of the mean.

> \\[ t = \frac{M_{DIFF}}{SE_M} \\]

Confidence Interval: For this test, the appropriate confidence interval is around (centered on) the mean difference (raw effect).

> \\[ CI_{DIFF} = M_{DIFF} \pm (t_{CRITICAL} ) (SE_M) \\]

Effect Size: Cohenâ€™s *d* Statistic provides a standardized effect size for the mean difference (raw effect).

> \\[ d = \frac{M_{DIFF}}{SD} \\]
