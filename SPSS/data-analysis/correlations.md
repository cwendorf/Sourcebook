 option from the main menu. 

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image27.png"></kbd></p>

#### Obtaining the Correlations (and Significance Tests)

3. A dialogue box will then 
 appear for you to choose 
 the variables of interest. 

4. Select the variables you 
 wish to analyze by 
 clicking on them and 
 hitting the arrow to move
 them into the "Variables"
 box. 

5. By default, SPSS will have 
 the "Pearson" box checked. 
 This provides the
 correlation coefficient we 
 discussed. Similarly,
 having "two-tailed" and
 "flag significant
 correlations" will create
 and display the
 significance tests 
 (discussed later in the
 class).

6. If all you wish is a table 
 of correlations (with no 
 descriptive statistics), 
 click "OK." A separate 
 window with the output 
 will appear.

 here and that you will 
 need to follow the next
 set of steps in order to 
 run the analyses.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image37.png"></kbd></p>

#### Defining the Groups to be Analyzed

6. In order to tell SPSS which
 two groups you wish to 
 compare, click on the
 "Define Groups" box. 

7. A new dialog box will
 appear. Here you will need 
 to indicate the numeric
 values you used in setting 
 up the data file to refer
 to the groups. In this 
 example, a value of 1 for
 the variable "group" 
 referred to Group 1 and a
 value of 2 for the 
 variable "group" referred

 appear for you to choose 
 the variables of interest. 

4. Select the outcome variables 
 you wish to analyze by 
 clicking on them and 
 hitting the arrow to move
 them into the "Dependent 
 List" box. 

5. Move the variable that 
 defines the different
 groups to the "Factor" 
 box. SPSS will not ask you 
 to define the groups you 
 wish to compare; it simply 
 will compare all groups
 defined by the factor. 

6. If all you wish is an ANOVA
 source table (with no
 descriptive statistics or
 post hoc tests), click 
 "OK." A separate window
 with the output will 
 appear.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image41.png"></kbd></p>

### Post Hoc Tests (OneWay ANOVA) 

#### Obtaining Multiple-Sample Inferential Statistics

1. First, enter the data. This
 is done in the same manner 
 as entering two sample data
 (described elsewhere) but
 with additional groups.

2. After the data are entered,
 select the "Analyze →
 Compare Means → One-Way
 ANOVA" option from the main
 menu.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image40.png"></kbd></p>

#### Obtaining the Significance Test 
 
3. A dialogue box will then 
 appear for you to choose the 
 variables of interest. 

4. Select the outcome variables 
 you wish to analyze by 
 clicking on them and hitting 
 the arrow to move them into
 the "Dependent List" box.

5. Move the variable that 
 defines the different groups 
 to the "Factor" box. SPSS
 will not ask you to define 
 the groups you wish to 
 compare; it simply will
 compare all groups defined 
 by the factor. 

6. If all you wish is an ANOVA
 source table (with no
 descriptive statistics or
 post hoc tests), click "OK." 
 A separate window with the 
 output will appear.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image41.png"></kbd></p>

#### Obtaining Descriptive Statistics

7. If you wish to get the 
 means, standard deviations,
 standard errors, and 95% 
 confidence intervals for 
 each group, select the 
 "Options" button.

 8. Another dialogue box will
 appear where you can choose
 various statistics. Select 
 "Descriptive." When you are
 done, click "Continue." This 
 will return you to the 
 original dialogue box. 

 9. If all you wish is an ANOVA
 with the descriptive 
 statistics (and no post hoc
 tests), click "OK." A
 separate window with the 
 output will appear.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image42.png"></kbd></p>

#### Obtaining Post Hoc Tests

10. If you wish to obtain post 
 hoc tests for the purpose of 
 making comparisons between 
 groups, click the "Post Hoc" 
 button.

11. Another dialogue box will
 appear where you can choose
 which post hoc tests you 
 wish. Select "Tukey" to get
 Tukey HSD post hoc tests.
 When you are done, click 
 "Continue."

12. After clicking on "OK" in
 the original dialogue box, a 
 separate window with the 
 output will appear.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image43.png"></kbd></p>

### General Linear Model (Repeated Measures ANOVA) 

#### Obtaining Repeated Measures Inferential Statistics

1. First, enter the repeated
 measures data. This is 
 described elsewhere. 

2. After the data are entered,
 select the "Analyze →
 General Linear Model → 
 Repeated Measures" option
 from the main menu.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image44.png"></kbd></p>

#### Labeling the Within-Subjects Variable/Factor 

3. A dialogue box will then 
 appear for you to create 
 the repeated measures
 factor. This box is
 necessary because SPSS 
 does not yet know which
 columns you wish to
 identify as repeated 
 measurements of the same 
 underlying factor. 

4. In the "Within-Subject 
 Factor Name" box, type in
 the name you wish to give
 to the repeated measures 
 factor. In this example, 
 since the
 measurements/columns 
 reflect quizzes at two 
 different times, "Time" is 
 used as the name.

5. In the "Number of Levels"
 box, indicate the number 
 of levels of the 
 within-subjects factor. In 
 this example, the quiz was 
 given twice, so there were 
 2 levels of the factor.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image45.png"></kbd></p>

#### Creating the Within-Subjects Factor

6. It is then important that
 you finalize the creation
 of the within-subjects 
 factor by clicking on the
 "Add" button. This 
 officially declares the
 new factor in SPSS.

7. Note that this factor only 
 exists in the computer's 
 memory. For examples,
 nowhere in the data set
 will you see a variable
 called "Time." 

8. When you have done this, 
 click on "Define." This
 will take you to the next
 step in setting up the 
 analysis.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image46.png"></kbd></p>

#### Obtaining the Significance Test

9. A dialogue box will then 
 appear for you to define 
 which columns/variables
 reflect the levels of the
 within-subjects factor.

10. Select the outcome variables 
 you wish to analyze by 
 clicking on them and 
 hitting the arrow to move
 them into the
 "Within-Subjects Variable" 
 box. In this example,
 "Outcome1" reflects the
 first level of the factor
 and "Outcome2" reflects
 the second level of the
 factor.

11. If all you wish is are ANOVA 
 source tables (with no 
 descriptive statistics or
 comparisons), click "OK."
 A separate window with the 
 output will appear.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image47.png"></kbd></p>

#### Obtaining Descriptive Statistics

 12. If you wish to get the 
 means, standard
 deviations, standard 
 errors, and 95% confidence 
 intervals for each group,
 select the "Options" 
 button.

 13. Another dialogue box will
 appear where you can 
 choose various statistics. 
 For means and standard 
 deviations, select 
 "Descriptive." When you
 are done, click
 "Continue." This will
 return you to the original 
 dialogue box.

 14. After clicking on "OK" in
 the original dialogue box, 
 a separate window with the 
 output will appear.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image48.png"></kbd></p>

### Obtaining Confidence Intervals

 15. If you wish to get the 
 confidence intervals for 
 each mean, select the "EM
 Means" button. 

 16. Another dialogue box will
 appear where you can 
 specify the Factor. Move 
 the relevant term to the 
 "Display Means" box. 

 17. When you are done, click 
 "Continue." This will
 return you to the original 
 dialogue box.

 18. After clicking on "OK" in
 the original dialogue box, 
 a separate window with the 
 output will appear.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image49.png"></kbd></p>

3. A dialogue box will then 
 appear for you to choose 
 the variables of interest. 

4. Select the outcome variable
 you wish to analyze by 
 clicking on it and hitting 
 the arrow to move them 
 into the "Dependent
 Variable" box. 

5. Move the variable(s) that
 defines the different
 groups to the "Fixed 
 Factor(s)" box. Note that
 SPSS will not require you
 to enter anything for the
 interaction if there are 
 multiple factors; it will
 automatically create the 
 interactions defined by
 the factor(s). 

6. If all you wish is an ANOVA
 source table (with no
 descriptive statistics), 
 click "OK." A separate 
 window with the output 
 will appear. 

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image51.png"></kbd></p>

#### Obtaining Descriptive Statistics

7. If you wish to get the means 
 and standard deviations
 for each group, select the 
 "Options" button.

8. Another dialogue box will
 appear where you can 
 choose various statistics. 
 Select "Descriptive
 statistics." 

9. If you wish to get 
 eta-squared measures for 
 each factor (and the 
 interaction), click on 
 "Estimates of effect 
 size." 

 10. When you are done, click 
 "Continue." This will
 return you to the original 
 dialogue box.

 11. After clicking on "OK" in
 the original dialogue box, 
 a separate window with the 
 output will appear.
