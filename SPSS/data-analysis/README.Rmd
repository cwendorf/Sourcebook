# SPSS | Data Analysis

## Frequencies (Frequencies and Descriptives) 

### Obtaining Frequency-Related Statistics

1. First, enter the data (described elsewhere). 

2. After the data are entered, select the "Analyze → Descriptive Statistics → Frequencies" option from the main menu. 

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="frequencies1.png"></kbd></p>

### Obtaining a Frequency Distribution

3. A dialogue box will then appear for you to choose the variables of interest. 

4. Select the variables you wish to analyze by clicking on them and then the arrow to move them  into the "variables" box.

5. Be sure that "Display frequency tables" is checked. Without this checked, you will not get a frequency distribution.

6. If all you wish is a frequency table (with no histogram or summary statistics), click "OK." A separate window with the output will appear.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="frequencies2.png"></kbd></p>

### Obtaining Summary Statistics 
 
7. To obtain summary statistics, select "Statistics." Another dialogue box will appear.

8. In this box, you can request that SPSS calculate the mean, variance, and standard deviation (or median and quartiles). 

9. Once you have selected the desired statistics, click "Continue." This will return you to the original dialogue box.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="frequencies3.png"></kbd></p>

5. Be sure that "Save standardized values as variables" is checked. Without this checked, you will not get the standardized scores. 

6. If all you wish are the standardized scores (with descriptive summary statistics), click "OK." A separate window with the output will appear.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="standardized2.png"></kbd></p>

### Obtaining Summary Statistics

7. To obtain summary statistics, select "Options." Another dialogue box will appear.

8. In this box, you can request that SPSS calculate the mean, variance, and standard deviation (and other statistics). 

9. Once you have selected the desired statistics, click "Continue." This will return you to the original dialogue box.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="standardized3.png"></kbd></p>

### Viewing the Standardized Scores  

10. After clicking on "OK" in the original dialogue box, a separate window with the output will appear.

11. Finally, note that the standardized variables are not included in the output. Rather, they are saved as new variables in the data view window. These variables can be used in subsequent analyses.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="standardized4.png"></kbd></p>

### Obtaining the Compute Menu

12. In addition to (or instead of) calculating standardized scores, you can perform other data transformations. First, enter the data (described elsewhere).

5. Move the variable that defines the different groups to the "Factor" box. SPSS will not ask you  to define the groups you wish to compare; it simply will compare all groups defined by the factor. 

6. If all you wish is an ANOVA source table (with no descriptive statistics or post hoc tests), click "OK." A separate window with the output will appear.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="oneway2.png"></kbd></p>

### Obtaining Descriptive Statistics

 7. If you wish to get the means, standard deviations, standard errors, and 95% confidence  intervals for each group, select the "Options" button.

 8. Another dialogue box will appear where you can choose various statistics. Select "Descriptive". When you are done, click "Continue". This will return you to the original dialogue box.

 9. If all you wish is an ANOVA with the descriptive statistics (and no post hoc tests), click "OK". A separate window with the output will appear.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="oneway3.png"></kbd></p>

## Post Hoc Comparisons (OneWay ANOVA) 

### Obtaining Multiple-Sample Inferential Statistics

2. After the data are entered, select the "Analyze → Compare Means → One-Way ANOVA" option from the main menu.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="posthoc1.png"></kbd></p>

### Obtaining the Significance Test 
 
3. A dialogue box will then appear for you to choose the variables of interest. 

4. Select the outcome variables you wish to analyze by clicking on them and clicking the arrow to move them into the "Dependent List" box.

5. Move the variable that defines the different groups to the "Factor" box. SPSS will not ask you to define the groups you wish to compare; it simply will compare all groups defined by the factor. 

6. If all you wish is an ANOVA source table (with no descriptive statistics or post hoc tests), click "OK." A separate window with the output will appear.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="posthoc2.png"></kbd></p>

### Obtaining Descriptive Statistics

7. If you wish to get the means, standard deviations, standard errors, and 95%  confidence intervals for each group, select the "Options" button.

 8. Another dialogue box will appear where you can choose various statistics. Select "Descriptive." When you are done, click "Continue." This will return you to the  original dialogue box. 

 9. If all you wish is an ANOVA with the descriptive  statistics (and no post hoc tests), click "OK." A separate window with the output will appear.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="posthoc3.png"></kbd></p>

### Obtaining Post Hoc Tests

10. If you wish to obtain post hoc tests for the purpose of making comparisons between  groups, click the "Post Hoc" button.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="posthoc4.png"></kbd></p>

## General Linear Model (Repeated Measures ANOVA) 

### Obtaining Repeated Measures Inferential Statistics

1. First, enter the repeated measures data. This is described elsewhere. 

2. After the data are entered, select the "Analyze → General Linear Model → Repeated Measures" option from the main menu.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="repeated1.png"></kbd></p>

### Labeling the Within-Subjects Variable/Factor 

3. A dialogue box will then appear for you to create the repeated measures factor. This box is necessary because SPSS does not yet know which columns you wish to identify as repeated measurements of the same underlying factor. 

4. In the "Within-Subject Factor Name" box, type in the name you wish to give to the repeated measures factor. In this example, since the measurements/columns reflect quizzes at two different times, "Time" is used as the name.

5. In the "Number of Levels" box, indicate the number of levels of the within-subjects factor. In  this example, the quiz was given twice, so there were 2 levels of the factor.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="repeated2.png"></kbd></p>

### Creating the Within-Subjects Factor

6. It is then important that you finalize the creation of the within-subjects factor by clicking on the "Add" button. This officially declares the new factor in SPSS.

7. Note that this factor only exists in the computer's memory. For examples, nowhere in the data set will you see a variable called "Time." 

8. When you have done this, click on "Define." This will take you to the next step in setting up the analysis.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="repeated3.png"></kbd></p>

### Obtaining the Significance Test

9. A dialogue box will then appear for you to define which columns/variables reflect the levels of the within-subjects factor.

10. Select the outcome variables you wish to analyze by clicking on them and clicking the arrow to move them into the "Within-Subjects Variable" box. In this example, "Outcome1" reflects the first level of the factor and "Outcome2" reflects the second level of the factor.

11. If all you wish is are ANOVA source tables (with no descriptive statistics or comparisons), click "OK." A separate window with the  output will appear.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="repeated4.png"></kbd></p>

### Obtaining Descriptive Statistics

 12. If you wish to get the means, standard deviations, standard errors, and 95% confidence  intervals for each group, select the "Options" button.

 13. Another dialogue box will appear where you can choose various statistics. For means and standard deviations, select "Descriptive." When you are done, click "Continue." This will return you to the original dialogue box.

 14. After clicking on "OK" in the original dialogue box, a separate window with the output will appear.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="repeated5.png"></kbd></p>

### Obtaining Confidence Intervals

 15. If you wish to get the confidence intervals for each mean, select the "EM Means" button. 

 16. Another dialogue box will appear where you can specify the Factor. Move the relevant term to the "Display Means" box. 

 17. When you are done, click "Continue." This will return you to the original dialogue box.

 18. After clicking on "OK" in the original dialogue box, a separate window with the  output will appear.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="repeated6.png"></kbd></p>

## Univariate Analysis of Variance (Factorial ANOVA) 

### Obtaining Factorial Inferential Statistics

1. First, enter the data (described elsewhere). 

2. After the data are entered, select the "Analyze → General Linear Model → Univariate" option from the main menu. 

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="factorial1.png"></kbd></p>

### Obtaining the Significance Test 

3. A dialogue box will then appear for you to choose the variables of interest. 

4. Select the outcome variable you wish to analyze by clicking on it and clicking the arrow to move them into the "Dependent Variable" box. 

5. Move the variable(s) that defines the different groups to the "Fixed  Factor(s)" box. Note that SPSS will not require you to enter anything for the interaction if there are multiple factors; it will automatically create the interactions defined by the factor(s). 

6. If all you wish is an ANOVA source table (with no descriptive statistics), click "OK." A separate window with the output will appear. 

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="factorial2.png"></kbd></p>

### Obtaining Descriptive Statistics

7. If you wish to get the means and standard deviations for each group, select the "Options" button.

8. Another dialogue box will appear where you can choose various statistics. Select "Descriptive statistics." 

9. If you wish to get eta-squared measures for each factor (and the interaction), click on "Estimates of effect size." 

 10. When you are done, click "Continue." This will return you to the original dialogue box.

 11. After clicking on "OK" in the original dialogue box, a separate window with the  output will appear.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="factorial3.png"></kbd></p>

### Obtaining Confidence Intervals
