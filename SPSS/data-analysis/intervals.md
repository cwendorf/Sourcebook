### Obtaining the Exploratory Statistics

3. A dialogue box will then appear for you to choose the variables of interest. 

4. Select the variables you wish to analyze by clicking on them and hitting the arrow to move them into the "Dependent List" box.

5. Be sure that "Statistics" is checked. This will limit your output to basic descriptive statistics and confidence intervals.

6. If you do not wish to alter the default (95%) confidence level, click "OK." A separate window with the output will appear.
