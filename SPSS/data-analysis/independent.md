#### Defining the Groups to be Analyzed

6. In order to tell SPSS which
 two groups you wish to 
 compare, click on the
 "Define Groups" box. 

7. A new dialog box will
 appear. Here you will need 
 to indicate the numeric
 values you used in setting 
 up the data file to refer
 to the groups. In this 
 example, a value of 1 for
 the variable "group" 
 referred to Group 1 and a
 value of 2 for the 
 variable "group" referred
 to Group 2.

8. When you are done, click 
 "Continue." This will
 return you to the original 
 dialogue box.

9. If you do not wish to alter
 the default (95%)
 confidence level, click
 "OK." A separate window
 with the output will 
 appear.

 appear where you can 
 change the confidence
 level. When you are done,

 will return you to the 
 original dialogue box.
