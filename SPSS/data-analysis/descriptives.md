### Obtaining Frequencies

3. A dialogue box will then appear for you to choose the variables of interest. 

4. Select the variables you wish to analyze by clicking on them and then the arrow to move them  into the "variables" box.

5. Be sure that "Display frequency tables" is checked. Without this checked, you will not get a frequency distribution.

6. If all you wish is a frequency table (with no histogram or summary statistics), click "OK." A separate window with the output will appear.
