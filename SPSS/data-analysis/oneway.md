## Data Analysis | OneWay ANOVA

### Selecting the Analysis

1. First, enter multiple group data (described elsewhere).

2. After the data are entered, select the "Analyze → Compare Means → One-Way ANOVA" option from the main menu.

### Obtaining Inferential Statistics

3. A dialogue box will then appear for you to choose the variables of interest. 

4. Select the outcome variables you wish to analyze by clicking on them and then the arrow to move them into the "Dependent List" box. 

5. Move the variable that defines the different groups to the "Factor" box. SPSS will not ask you  to define the groups you wish to compare; it simply will compare all groups defined by the factor. 

6. Check “Estimate effect size for overall tests” to obtain eta-squared.

7. If all you wish is an ANOVA source table (with no descriptive statistics or post hoc tests), click "OK." A separate window with the output will appear.

### Obtaining Descriptive Statistics

 8. If you wish to get the means, standard deviations, standard errors, and 95% confidence  intervals for each group, select the "Options" button.

 9. Another dialogue box will appear where you can choose various statistics. Select "Descriptive". When you are done, click "Continue". This will return you to the original dialogue box.

 10. If all you wish is an ANOVA with the descriptive statistics (and no post hoc tests), click "OK". A separate window with the output will appear.
