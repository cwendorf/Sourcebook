### Obtaining Inferential Statistics 

3. A dialogue box will then appear for you to choose the variables of interest. 

4. Select the variables you wish to analyze by clicking on them and hitting the arrow to move them into the "Test Variables" box.

5. Be sure to enter a known or hypothesized mean into the "Test Value" field. If you do not enter a value here, SPSS will automatically use zero as the comparison mean. 

6. Check the "Estimates of effect size" to get Cohen's d.

7. If you do not wish to alter the default (95%) confidence level, click "OK." A separate window with the output will appear.
