# Statistics for Social Science

## Using and Understanding SPSS

---

## Using the Software

[**Using the Software:**](./using-software/) This chapter provides step-by-step instructions on how to obtain basic statistical output using SPSS, both visually with screenshots and via written instructions. Simple examples for most undergraduate-level between-subjects and within-subjects research designs are provided.

## Annotated Output

[**Annotated Output:**](./annotated-output/) This chapter is intended to facilitate the connection between standard introductory statistics concepts and their implementation in SPSS. It shows the output from various types of analyses, describes how to interpret the output, and shows the link between hand calculation formulas and SPSS output. Results derive from the examples in the other sections of this project.

## Blank Output

[**Blank Output:**](./blank-output/) This chapter is used as a set of worksheets for class problems. Students fill in their answers on these sheets, thus making clear the links between non-computer (“hand”) calculations and the SPSS output.
