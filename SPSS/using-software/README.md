## Entering Multiple Sample Data 

### Steps for Defining All Variables 

1. First, click on the
 "Variable View" tab on the 
 bottom left-hand corner of 
 the screen. Generally
 speaking, this is where
 you will define all of the 
 variables in the data set. 

2. Type in the "Name" of the
 variables in the first 
 column. You may wish to
 enter a "Label" (or longer 
 name) for each variable in 
 your data set. 

3. One variable will represent
 the Factor (Independent
 Variable) and the other
 will represent the Outcome 
 (Dependent) Variable.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image5.jpg"></kbd></p>

### Steps for Providing Labels for All Values

4. For categorical variables, 
 you should also provide
 labels for the different 
 categories. Do this by 
 clicking on the "values" 
 cell for the variable of 
 interest. A button will
 appear and clicking on 
 this button will make
 another dialog box appear. 

5. You will use numbers to
 represent the two
 categories (or "levels") 
 of the variable. Do this 
 by entering the number 
 representing the value in
 the "value" box and the
 actual value in the
 "label" box. Click "Add" 
 after entering the 
 information for each 
 value. If your data set
 includes more than two 
 groups, simply specify 
 values and labels for each 
 of the groups. 

6. When you have labeled all
 the values, click "OK" to
 return to the "Variable
 View." 

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image6.jpg"></kbd></p>

### Steps for Entering Data

 7. Click on the "Data View" tab

 corner. In this view, you
 will be able to enter the
 data.

 8. Enter the data for all the 
 participants. Notice that
 each participant has 
 scores on both the Factor
 and Outcome Variables. 
 There will be as many rows 
 as people. 

 9. On the categorical Factor, 
 use the values that you
 indicated when defining
 the variables earlier. 

 10. If your data set has more
 than two groups, simply be 
 sure to add a group
 indicator (a value on the
 "Factor" variable) and an
 "Outcome" for each 
 additional person.

2. Type in a "Name" for each of 
 the variables in the first 
 column. You may wish to
 enter a "Label" (or longer 
 name) for each variable in 
 your data set. 

3. Two variables will represent 
 the Factors (Independent 
 Variables) and the other 
 will represent the Outcome 
 (Dependent) Variable.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image8.jpg"></kbd></p>

### Steps for Providing Labels for All Values

4. For categorical variables, 
 you should also provide
 labels for the different 
 categories. Do this by 
 clicking on the "values" 
 cell for the variable of 
 interest. A button will
 appear and clicking on 
 this button will make
 another dialog box appear. 

5. You will use numbers to
 represent the two
 categories (or "levels") 
 of the variable. Do this 
 by entering the number 
 representing the value in
 the "value" box and the
 actual value in the
 "label" box. Click "Add" 
 after entering the 
 information for each 
 value. If your data set
 includes more than two 
 groups, simply specify 
 values and labels for each 
 of the groups. 

6. When you have labeled all
 the values, click "OK" to
 return to the "Variable
 View." 

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image9.jpg"></kbd></p>

### Steps for Entering Data

 7. Click on the "Data View" tab 
 on the bottom left-hand
 corner. In this view, you
 will be able to enter the
 data.

 8. Enter the data for all of
 the participants. Notice 
 that each participant has
 scores on both of the
 Factors and on the Outcome 
 Variable. There will be as 
 many rows as people. 

 9. On the categorical Factors,
 use the values that you
 indicated when defining
 the variables earlier. 
 Note that the combination
 of values in the Factors 
 will define the multiple 
 groups of the factorial
 design.

 10. If your data set has more
 than two levels for either 
 (or both) of the Factors,
 simply be sure to add an 
 indicator and an outcome 
 value for each additional
 person.

 appear for you to create 
 the repeated measures
 factor. This box is
 necessary because SPSS 
 does not yet know which
 columns you wish to
 identify as repeated 
 measurements of the same 
 underlying factor. 

4. In the "Within-Subject 
 Factor Name" box, type in
 the name you wish to give
 to the repeated measures 
 factor. In this example, 
 since the
 measurements/columns 
 reflect quizzes at two 
 different times, "Time" is 
 used as the name.

5. In the "Number of Levels"
 box, indicate the number 
 of levels of the 
 within-subjects factor. In 
 this example, the quiz was 
 given twice, so there were 
 2 levels of the factor.

### Steps for Creating the Within-Subjects Factor

6. It is then important that
 you finalize the creation
 of the within-subjects 
 factor by clicking on the
 "Add" button. This 
 officially declares the
 new factor in SPSS.

7. Note that this factor only 
 exists in the computer's 
 memory. For examples,
 nowhere in the data set
 will you see a variable
 called "Time." 

8. When you have done this, 
 click on "Define." This
 will take you to the next
 step in setting up the 
 analysis.

### Steps for Obtaining the Significance Test

9. A dialogue box will then 
 appear for you to define 
 which columns/variables
 reflect the levels of the
 within-subjects factor.

10. Select the outcome variables 
 you wish to analyze by 
 clicking on them and 
 hitting the arrow to move
 them into the
 "Within-Subjects Variable" 
 box. In this example,
 "Outcome1" reflects the
 first level of the factor
 and "Outcome2" reflects
 the second level of the
 factor.

11. If all you wish is are ANOVA 
 source tables (with no 
 descriptive statistics or
 comparisons), click "OK."
 A separate window with the 
 output will appear.

### Steps for Obtaining Descriptive Statistics

 12. If you wish to get the 
 means, standard
 deviations, standard 
 errors, and 95% confidence 
 intervals for each group,
 select the "Options" 
 button.

 13. Another dialogue box will
 appear where you can 
 choose various statistics. 
 For means and standard 
 deviations, select 
 "Descriptive." When you
 are done, click
 "Continue." This will
 return you to the original 
 dialogue box.

 14. After clicking on "OK" in
 the original dialogue box, 
 a separate window with the 
 output will appear.

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image48.jpg"></kbd></p>

## Steps for Obtaining Confidence Intervals

 15. If you wish to get the 
 confidence intervals for 
 each mean, select the "EM
 Means" button. 

 16. Another dialogue box will
 appear where you can 
 specify the Factor. Move 
 the relevant term to the 
 "Display Means" box. 

 17. When you are done, click 
 "Continue." This will
 return you to the original 
 dialogue box.

 18. After clicking on "OK" in
 the original dialogue box, 
 a separate window with the 
 output will appear.

## Univariate Analysis of Variance (Factorial ANOVA) 

### Steps for Obtaining Factorial Inferential Statistics

1. First, enter the data
 (described elsewhere). 

2. After the data are entered,
 select the "Analyze →
 General Linear Model → 
 Univariate" option from
 the main menu.

### Steps for Obtaining the Significance Test 

3. A dialogue box will then 
 appear for you to choose 
 the variables of interest. 

4. Select the outcome variable
 you wish to analyze by 
 clicking on it and hitting 
 the arrow to move them 
 into the "Dependent
 Variable" box. 

5. Move the variable(s) that
 defines the different
 groups to the "Fixed 
 Factor(s)" box. Note that
 SPSS will not require you
 to enter anything for the
 interaction if there are 
 multiple factors; it will
 automatically create the 
 interactions defined by
 the factor(s). 

6. If all you wish is an ANOVA
 source table (with no
 descriptive statistics), 
 click "OK." A separate 
 window with the output 
 will appear. 

<p align="center"><kbd><img src="image51.jpg"></kbd></p>

### Steps for Obtaining Descriptive Statistics

7. If you wish to get the means 
 and standard deviations
 for each group, select the 
 "Options" button.

8. Another dialogue box will
 appear where you can 
 choose various statistics. 
 Select "Descriptive
 statistics." 

9. If you wish to get 
 eta-squared measures for 
 each factor (and the 
 interaction), click on 
 "Estimates of effect 
 size." 

 10. When you are done, click 
 "Continue." This will
 return you to the original 
 dialogue box.

 11. After clicking on "OK" in
 the original dialogue box, 
 a separate window with the 
 output will appear.

### Steps for Obtaining Confidence Intervals

12.If you wish to get the 
 confidence intervals for 
 each mean, select the "EM
 Means" button. 

13. Another dialogue box will
 appear where you can 
 specify which effects
 (main effects and
 interactions) to analyze.
 Move the relevant terms to 
 the "Display Means" box. 

14. When you are done, click 
 "Continue." This will
 return you to the original 
 dialogue box.

15. After clicking on "OK" in
 the original dialogue box,
