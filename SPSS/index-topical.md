## [SPSS Articles](./index-topical.md)

This reorganized index page provides links to the various materials available for using SPSS to analyze examples. [The original index](./index.md) organizes the materials by the goals of the pages (i.e, Data Entry, Data Analysis, Annotated Output) rather than by topic (e.g., One Sample t Test, ANOVA, etc.). 

### Frequencies

These pages show how to obtain and calculate frequency distributions and percentiles.

- Data Entry: [One Sample Data](./data-entry/onesample.md)
- Data Analysis: [Frequencies and Descriptives](./data-analysis/descriptives.md)
- Annotated Output: [Frequencies and Descriptives](./annotated-output/descriptives.md)

### Descriptives

These pages show how to obtain and calculate descriptive statistics such as the mean and standard deviation.

- Data Entry: [One Sample Data](./data-entry/onesample.md)
- Data Analysis: [Frequencies and Descriptives](./data-analysis/descriptives.md)
- Annotated Output: [Frequencies and Descriptives](./annotated-output/descriptives.md)

### Transformations and Standardized Scores

These pages show how to transform data, especially into standardized scores.

- Data Entry: [One Sample Data](./data-entry/onesample.md)
- Data Analysis: [Transformations and Standardized Scores](./data-analysis/standardized.md)

### Correlations

These pages show how to obtain and calculate correlations.

- Data Entry: [Paired and Repeated Measures Data](./data-entry/repeated.md)
- Data Analysis: [Correlations](./data-analysis/correlations.md)

### Regression

These pages show how to obtain and calculate a regression model.

- Data Entry: [Paired and Repeated Measures Data](./data-entry/repeated.md)
- Data Analysis: [Regression](./data-analysis/regression.md)
- Annotated Output: [Regression](./annotated-output/regression.md)

### Confidence Interval for a Mean

These pages show how to obtain and calculate a confidence interval for a mean.

- Data Entry: [One Sample Data](./data-entry/onesample.md)
- Data Analysis: [Confidence Interval for a Mean](./data-analysis/intervals.md)
- Annotated Output: [Confidence Interval for a Mean](./annotated-output/intervals.md)

### One Sample t Test

These pages show how to obtain and calculate statistical significance, an effect size, and a confidence interval for one sample.

- Data Entry: [One Sample Data](./data-entry/onesample.md)
- Data Analysis: [One Sample t Test](./data-analysis/onesample.md)
- Annotated Output: [One Sample t Test](./annotated-output/onesample.md)

### Paired Samples t Test

These pages show how to obtain and calculate statistical significance, an effect size, and a confidence interval for paired samples.

- Data Entry: [Paired and Repeated Measures Data](./data-entry/repeated.md)
