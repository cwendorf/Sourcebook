## Paired Samples t Test

### APA Style

For this analysis, the differences between two measurements on one set of people are being compared. Thus, the summary and the inferential statistics focus on that difference. The first example focuses on statistical significance testing, whereas as the second version includes and emphasizes interpretation of the confidence interval and effect size. Alternatively, the means, standard deviations, and confidence intervals could be presented in a table or figure associated with this text.

> A paired samples *t* test showed that the difference in Outcome scores (*N* = 4) between the first time point (*M* = 2.00, *SD* = 2.45) and second time point (*M* = 6.00, *SD* = 2.45) was statistically significant, *t*(3) = -3.27, *p* = .047.

> Analyses revealed that Outcome scores (*N* = 4) increased dramatically from the first time point (*M* = 2.00, *SD* = 2.45) to the second time point (*M* = 6.00, *SD* = 2.45), 95% CI [-7.90, -0.10], *d* = -1.63, *t*(3) = -3.27, *p* = .047.
