## Summaries: Confidence Intervals

### APA Style

Confidence intervals provide a range estimate for a population value (e.g., the mean). Note that the width of the interval can be altered to reflect the level of confidence in the estimate. Both of the following versions present the required information, though the second focuses more on the interpretation of the statistic.

> The eight participants had a mean Outcome score of 4.00 (SD = 3.12), 95% CI [1.39, 6.61].

> The participants (*N* = 8) scored low on the Outcome (M = 4.00, SD = 3.12), 95% CI [1.39, 6.61].
