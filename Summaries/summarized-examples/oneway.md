## One-Way ANOVA

### APA Style

The ANOVA provides an omnibus test of the differences across multiple groups. Because the ANOVA tests the overall differences among the groups, the text discusses the differences in general. The first example focuses on statistical significance testing, whereas as the second version includes and emphasizes interpretation of the effect size. Alternatively, the means, standard deviations, and confidence intervals could be presented in a table or figure associated with this text.

> A one way ANOVA showed that the differences in Outcome scores between the first group (*n* = 3, *M* = 2.00, *SD* = 2.45), the second group (*n* = 3, *M* = 6.00, *SD* = 2.45), and the third group (*n* = 3, *M* = 7.00, *SD* = 2.45) were statistically significant, *F*(2,9) = 4.67, *p* = .041.

> Analyses revealed large overall differences in Outcome scores between the first group (*n* = 3, *M* = 2.00, *SD* = 2.45), the second group (*n* = 3, *M* = 6.00, *SD* = 2.45), and the third group (*n* = 3, *M* = 7.00, *SD* = 2.45), *eta*<sup>2</sup> = .51, *F*(2,9) = 4.67, *p* = .041.
