## Summaries: Correlations

### APA Style

Correlations provide a measure of statistical relationship between two variables. Note that correlations can also have inferential information associated with them (and that this information should be summarized if it is available and of interest).

> For the participants (*N* = 4), the scores on Outcome 1 (*M* = 2.00, *SD* = 2.45) and Outcome 2 (*M* = 6.00, *SD* = 2.45) were moderately correlated, *r*(2) = .50.

> For the participants (*N* = 4), the scores on Outcome 1 (*M* = 2.00, *SD* = 2.45) and Outcome 2 (*M* = 6.00, *SD* = 2.45) were moderately but not statistically significantly correlated, *r*(2) = .50, 95% CI [-0.89, 0.99], *p* = .500.
