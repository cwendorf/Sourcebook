## Summaries: Descriptives

### APA Style Summary

The purpose of descriptive statistics is to provide the reader with an idea about the basic elements of the group(s) being studied. Note that this also forms the basis of the in-text presentation of descriptive statistics for other inferential analyses. Both of the following versions present the required information, though the second focuses more on the interpretation of the statistic.

> The eight participants had a mean Outcome of 4.00 (*SD* = 3.12).

> The participants (*N* = 8) had a low mean Outcome score (*M* = 4.00, *SD* = 3.12).
